Source code contains 4 scenarios:

1. fine tuning (only fully-connected layers)
    
2. fine tuning (fully-connected layers and last conv layers)
    
3. train whole network and then cut some (ie. 1 or more conv, regularization layers etc.) and retrain
    
4. extract CNN codes and train SVM (with linear, quadratic, polynomial kernels)
